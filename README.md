# angularjs-large-dataset-performance
AngularJS Large Dataset Performance Demo. The project contains sample data files as well as the data file generator script (generate-records.py). The NG app simply displays data and allows the user to search/sort the dataset.

The dataset is in the following format:
[
  {"company":"COMPANY","email":"EMAIL","firstName":"FNAME","id":ID,"lastName":"LNAME","phone":"PHONE-NUMBER","state":"US_STATE"},...
]
